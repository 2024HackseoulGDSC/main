## **Used technologies**

Our team utilized Node.js and React.


## **Problem Statement**

#### **Main Target**

 Teenagers and young adults in their 20s who want to make efficient use of the e-commerce market by relying on objective data rather than being swayed by advertisements, while also drawing inspiration from what others are purchasing.

#### **Main Problem**

In the cosmetics market, Olive Young holds the largest share, supported by a well-established review system and significant influence from YouTuber promotions and collaborations. There is a noticeable trend where consumers follow the purchasing habits of influencers. In other sectors, influencer-driven marketing is still relatively untapped, with information scattered across various platforms. As a result, consumers are spending a considerable amount of time deciding which products to purchase.


## **Solution**

#### **Overview**

Users can browse the shopping carts of others(influencers and regular customers) within Coupang.

#### **Expected Benefits**

- This feature will enhance product promotion, driving an increase in purchase rates by sparking consumer interest.
- It will elevate the window-shopping experience on Coupang, particularly for those who enjoy shopping as a hobby.
- Allowing users to explore the carts of ordinary shoppers with no promotional intent will boost trust, reduce decision-making time, and improve shopping efficiency on Coupang, where the product selection is vast.
